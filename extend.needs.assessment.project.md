# Duke Extend Platform Needs Assessment

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-good-brightgreen.svg)]()

## Descrition of the project
The platform needs assessment project for Duke Extend is considering 
1. critical criteria that are must-have features, 
2. differentiating criteria that are highly valued but can strike a balance between platform strengths and deficits, and 
3. optional criteria that would be of interest to our team but would not be used for final decision-making.

### Project goals
1. Compare current best fit candidates for Duke Extend online learning experiences based on authentic criteria.
2. Recommend course of action to administration to either remain with Open edX or switch to a different platform.
3. Document needs assessment and comparison for future use.  

### Steps
1. Collect, consolidate and rank key criteria for the Duke Extend platform
2. Survey a range of potential platforms and select promising potential candidates from representative types
3. Review candidate platforms in small groups based on the ranked criteria
	1. Review one criteria at a time across all candidates, starting with the highest ranked criterion
	2. Consider both current and future needs by operating two different review teams with separate focus
4. Compile and share recommendations from sprint groups with administration
5. Procure supplementary information and review to support admin decision-making
6. Document review process for future use and reference
