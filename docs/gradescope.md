# Gradescope

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pilot-brightgreen.svg)

Gradescope is a grading workflow application that saves faculty time spent in the grading process while creating stronger student assessment through standardized rubrics.

### team
@DukeLearning  
@EdGomes  
@compsci    

# goals
1. distribute use of gradescope to many disciplines across the university in order to effectively use enterprise vs user licensing.

This goal was selected to measure the broad adoption of Gradescope at Duke. Widespread use of Gradescope across many departments is an effective use of enterprise licensing.

# project management
Product Owner - Learning Innovation Admin Team  
Scrummaster - Michael Greene

As grading is universal across the university, this project is the responsibility of the entire Learning Innovation department, everyone plays some small role in increasing adoption. 

The project is managed via 4 week sprints which begin with a sprint planning meeting to check in on progress, obstacles, metrics, and decide next steps for the upcoming sprint.

Everyone in Learning Innovation is invited to the sprint planning meetings.

The scrummaster will meet with the admin team in during the sprint to prioritize the backlog.

The project backlog is managed in [the EP: Gradescope basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3615344/projects/6132066)

### metrics

metric | details
---|---
assignments graded | measured per sprint. tracks growth. the interaction that provides value to faculty
new active departments / 207 | measured per sprint. tracks progress towards project goal. 206 is the number of disciplines in the SISS feed for Spring 18
new gradescope students / 15,192  | measured per sprint. tracks progress towards reaching at cost vs per user licensing. 15,192 is Duke's total students reported on facts.duke.edu on 1/8/18
happy users / total users | measured per sprint. tracks user satisfaction


**secondary metrics**

metric | details
---|---
assignments graded per department per sprint | combines the first two primary metrics, could be a possible replacement for them
consults / new gradescope faculty | tracks potential pedagogical impact of the project
New active users per sprint | tracks growth
new assignments this sprint / total assignments | tracks growth
total gradescope students / 15,192 | measured per sprint. tracks how close we are to reaching at cost using enterprise vs per-user licensing. 15,192 is Duke's total students reported on facts.duke.edu on 1/8/18
faculty with more than 1 assignment per sprint | tracks recurring user growth
faculty with assignments in back to back sprints per sprint | tracks recurring user growth

### Changed
During the 2017 Learning Innovation Fellows program, it was discovered that Gradescope had gained popularity on campus in Computer Science and many faculty in that program were immediately interested upon seeing it for the first time.

Gradescope began offering an institutional service in summer 2017 and Learning Innovation negotiated a contract for pilot in fall 2017.
