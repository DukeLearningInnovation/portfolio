# Gradescope

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pilot-brightgreen.svg)

Gradescope is a grading workflow application that saves faculty time spent in the grading process while creating stronger student assessment through standardized rubrics.

During the 2017 Learning Innovation Fellows program, it was discovered that Gradescope had gained popularity on campus in Computer Science and many faculty in that program were immediately interested upon seeing it for the first time.

Gradescope began offering an institutional service in summer 2017 and Learning Innovation negotiated a contract for pilot in fall 2017.

# goals
1. distribute use of gradescope to __ departments beyond Computer Science

# project management
This project is the responsibility of the entire Learning Innovation department, everyone plays some small role in increasing adoption. 

The project is managed via 2-4 week sprints.

Each sprint will begin with a sprint planning meeting to check in on progress, obstacles, metrics, and decide next steps for the upcoming sprint.

Everyone in Learning Innovation is invited to the sprint planning meetings.

### metrics
metric | details
---|---
assignments graded | measured per sprint. tracks growth. the interaction that provides value to faculty
new active departments | measured per sprint. tracks progress towards project goal
total gradescope students / FTE | measured per sprint. tracks how close we are to reaching at cost using enterprise vs per-user licensing
happy users / total users | measured per sprint. tracks user satisfaction


Other possible or secondary metrics

metric | details
---|---
assignments graded per department per sprint | combines the first two primary metrics, could be a possible replacement for them
consults / new gradescope faculty | tracks potential pedagogical impact of the project
New active users per sprint | tracks growth
new assignments this sprint / total assignments | tracks growth
new gradescope students / FTE | tracks progress towards reaching at cost vs per user licensing
new students / total gradescope students | tracks growth
faculty with more than 1 assignment per sprint | tracks recurring user growth
faculty with assignments in back to back sprints per sprint | tracks recurring user growth
