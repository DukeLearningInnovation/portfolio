learn.duke is where learners start interacting with their learning communities. It connects them to a unified interface for accessing their instructional tools. 

We have observed that Toolkits isnâ€™t meeting this goal, which is causing communities to either rely on a single solution, the LMS, or use unsupported tools - even when a supported alternative exists. 

How might learn.duke improve this to accommodate the entire range of learning communities, those that use a single tool, those using multiple supported tools, and those using their preferred, unsupported tools? 

How might learn.duke encourage our learning communities to more frequently use the best tools to meet their learning goals and taking less energy to do so?
