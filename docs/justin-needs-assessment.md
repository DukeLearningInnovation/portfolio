# Duke Extend Platform Needs Assessment

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-good-brightgreen.svg)

## Descrition of the project
The platform needs assessment project for Duke Extend is considering 1) critical criteria that are must-have features, 2) differentiating criteria that are highly valued but can strike a balance between platform strengths and deficits, and 3) optional criteria that would be of interest to our team but would not be used for final decision-making.

### Project team

### Project goals
1. Compare current best fit candidates for Duke Extend online learning experiences based on authentic criteria.
2. Recommend course of action to administration to either remain with Open edX or switch to a different platform.
3. Document needs assessment and comparison for future use.  

## Criteria collection and classification

Our criteria have evolved over time. Our initial set of criteria was drawn from a previous platform comparison set of use cases, our own use cases after implementing the Open edX platform, and additional new ideas for use cases based on potential or desired projects that had not yet been initiated. Our Duke Extend service team reviewed this list of criteria and gave each a +1/0/-1 vote. That list is in Google Drive:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Efgz2Ym4mH0VjPFme6sedj2eyDtl8nSCHFUb1xoYJ6s/edit?usp=sharing

Each use case begins with “We’re looking for a platform(s) that allows the university to...”

1. Deliver courses over a variety of modalities to mixed audiences at traditional and large scales.
2. Offer training and assessment in basic technical skills to Duke affiliates and the public. 
3. Partner with other universities to deliver the same course to all students at once in one learning space. 
4. Show student progress to individual learners.++
5. Allow experimentation and demonstration of the capabilities of the platform.
6. Add traditional and large scale, mixed audiences to specific modules/features/tools of a course. 
7. Scale to incorporate up to 10,000 learners in a single course.
8. Add traditional and large scale, mixed audiences to an entire course regardless of original audience and without the need for prior student enrollment or account creation. 
9. Facilitate hardware training and track and validate document learning in an always-available resource.
10. Provide sensible methods for authentication and access to traditional and large scale mixed audiences.
11. Offer for-credit Duke courses to remote or prospective Duke students over summer terms.
12. Facilitate engaging group work and community beyond the discussion board at large scale. 
13. Add to alumni benefits, promote community among alumni, and increase connection between alumni and Duke.  
14. Automate certificate generation upon completion for mixed audiences at traditional and large scale.
15. Create properly licensed, modular content that can be remixed by mixed audiences and delivered to students regardless of platform.
16. Satisfy accessibility requirements held by the university (such as video captioning).
17. Offer training in professional areas outside the scope of university coursework.
18. Provide seamless integration of external tools within the platform.
19. Provide learner analytics across students, sections, subjects, degrees, and across platforms.
20. Easily offer access to Duke for-credit courses to non-Duke or remote students from multiple international locations. 
21. Manage student assessment of team contribution regardless of platform. 
22. Allow staff depts to offer technical training to new employees.

25. Participate in an active development community.
26. Add mixed access to student created content. 
27. Offer free MOOC-type courses with customized start times and durations. 
28. Audit an entire course or sections of a course against quality standards set by CIT and the University.
29. Show course-wide student progress to instructors (grades & responses to assessments)
30. Content created within the platform can be used simultaneously in other platforms via embed or other functionality.
31. Deliver content created outside the platform. 
32. Delegated access and elevated permissions be granted to appropriate individuals via self-service regardless of platform.
33. Offer a well-designed, modern interface to students and instructors.
34. Gain wide visibility for its courses to eligible learners.
35. Provide an open online course alternative to Coursera.
36. Platform is Duke branded 
37. Control options related to 
	1. time of release, 
	2. duration of release, 
	3. frequency of release, 
	4. certification, 
	5. eligible learner population, and
	6. frequency and nature of platform updates.
38. Tailor flow control of student experience through the course (adaptive learning)

Based on our team conversation about these criteria, we identified that many of them are complex combinations of features that made evaluation difficult. So I deconstructed a number of the criteria into a longer list of simpler features.

After further review and discussion, this list was consolidated into new criteria with fewer overlaps between features, listed below. These criteria were written on cards, one criterion per card, and shared with several staff in Learning Innovation to gain their perspectives about the importance of each. Participants were asked to identify critical criteria or non-essential criteria; all remaining criteria were considered as 'differentiating'. After eight participants contributed their input, the criteria were ranked and classified. Upvotes were based on a participant identifying a criterion as 'critical' and downvotes were based on a participant identifying a criterion as 'unnecessary' or 'non-essential'. After the exercise, participants were each asked two questions. What guiding principles did you rely on to make your classifications? What, if any, additional criteria would you suggest we consider for this platform comparison?

## Candidate selection

Our Duke Extend service team's initial list of candidate platforms included:
* Tsugi
* ELMS LN
* WordPress LMS plug-ins
* Drupal distributions
* Moodle Academy
* OpenCraft hosting of Open edX

After discussion with our Learning Innovation admin team and others, and some research online into available alternatives, several more initial candidates were added.
* Kannu
* Udemy
* Schoology
* Docebo
* LifterLMS (a WordPress LMS plug-in)
* LearnDash (another WordPress LMS plug-in)
* Opigno LMS (a Drupal distribution)

Deeper platform research by @JustinJohnsen identified questions and weaknesses in several of the candidates, summarized below.
* One question about WP LMS is whether we can do everything Extend-related on one 'site', since many pricing options are based on the number of sites.
* Tsugi seems important but way to theoretical or early-stage to be useful as a Coursera backup, especially perception-wise. Also likely would need at least one if not more dedicated developers/programmers.
* ELMS appears more plausible than Tsugi, but still too new for full rollout like we want to offer in Extend. It definitely looks like it is moving in the direction we want, though. If we had the bandwidth, we should try using it for an internal purpose, maybe forming a LTS product review library or for our R&D team to document their efforts. That way we could get more firsthand experience and deeper evaluation without the pressure that producing public courses would bring.
* Udemy has a lot of documentation supporting instructors, but I'm concerned about the ability to host the courses through extend.duke.edu and about the freedom to opt out of discounts deals and other marketing actions.
* Moodle Academy's home website is so bad and simple that I immediately dropped it from consideration as a candidate.

Following more discussion with the Duke Extend service team and the Learning Technology team, we trimmed the candidate list down to four.
* OpenCraft hosting of Open edX (i.e. status quo platform)
* Kannu
* Schoology
* LearnDash WP plug-in
