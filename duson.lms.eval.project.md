Announced at the DUSON FGA meeting on Monday, Feb. 26, the goal of this year-long project is to determine if Sakai is meeting our (DUSON) LMS requirements for both classroom and distance-based classes. If it is not, we will pilot one or more alternatives, evaluate, and determine next steps. 

Phase I (April, May) – Getting Started:  Six 1-hour meetings over two months to look at requirements & LMS environments.  We will also decide if we would like to pilot any other LMS environments and, if so, which one(s).

Phase II (May – July) – Pre-Pilot:  Two 1-hour meetings to review pilot course development.

Phase III (August – December) – Pilot:  One monthly meeting to evaluate progress.
Phase IV (January) – Evaluation:  One meeting in January to evaluate feedback and consider next steps.
