This project is a collaboration between Duke Web Services, Learning Technoloiges, and the Sakai Community.  The goal of the project is reveal inconsistencies in Sakai's user interface by creating an inventory of the UI elements throughout the application. The community will work with DWS and LT to review the inventory results, make decisions about Sakai's overall UI and style, ultimately creating a style guide/pattern library which will be used to make the application more consistent.
